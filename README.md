# Siege-Settings-app

It's annoying to go into the Documents folder and manually edit lines in GameSettings.ini so I made this.

Provides a UI for easily changing many settings for Rainbow 6 Siege, things like sensitivities and mouse multipliers, display options like fov, refresh rate, etc.

Upon running it creates a backup file of settings in case the user wants to revert, the file is called GameSettings.ini.backup in the same folder as GameSettings.ini
